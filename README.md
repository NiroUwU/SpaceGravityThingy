The "Game" -----

You are a small spaceship researching an alien planet. By flying close to the planet your radars are capable of scanning the surface - but not too close as you will crash!

Controlls -----

 - Arrow-keys for direction
 - 'r' to restart the game (highscore gets saved as long the app is not terminated)
   
Future -----
- gravity
- heat system (spaceship overheats if too fast and freezes if to slow, so there is a motivation to stay in motion)
